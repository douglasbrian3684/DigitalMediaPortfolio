    <p><em>Welcome to the About Me page!</em></p>
    <p>I am currently a senior in high school in Salt Lake City, Utah. I haven't officially accepted any offers of admission from colleges, but I'm planning on attending McGill University in Montreal, Canada. I'm still not sure what I want to major in; there are so many subjects I find fascinating! At the moment, though, I'll most likely get a Bachelor's in English or Journalism, and then potentially get a Master's in one of the two subjects. But I'm also interested in History, Political Science, Literature, Statistics, and even Film. </p>
    <p>My biggest interest is definitely writing. More than anything in the world, I want to write things that people will read, and have my name known. I'm already working on it. In a similar vein as a lot of my favorite authors, what I like to write would most likely be classified as absurdist fiction, paranoid fiction, and postmodern fiction. Some of my favorite authors include Samuel Beckett, Jorge Luis Borges, Albert Camus, Truman Capote, David Foster Wallace, Stefan Zweig, Oscar Wilde, and James Joyce.</p>
    <p>Other interests of mine include drumming, music, movies, and traveling. Of course, I don't get do to much of the latter, but I'm hoping that I'll have the opportunity to visit plenty of places in the future. </p>
