    <p><em>Welcome to the About Me page!</em></p>
    <p>I just graduated from high school in Salt Lake City, Utah. I'll be going to Fordham University in New York City in the fall. I'm planning on pursuing a degree in English and Literature, and then getting a graduate degree in teaching, and teaching in high school or college. But I'm also interested in History, Political Science, Literature, Statistics, and even Film. </p>
    <p>My biggest interest is definitely writing. More than anything in the world, I want to write things that people will read, and have my name known. I'm already working on it. In a similar vein as a lot of my favorite authors, what I like to write would most likely be classified as absurdist fiction, magic realism, and surrealism. Some of my favorite authors include Samuel Beckett, Haruki Murakami, Franz Kafka, Stefan Zweig, Kurt Vonnegut, and Truman Capote.</p>
    <p>Other interests of mine include drumming, music, movies, and traveling. Of course, I don't get do to much of the latter, but I'm hoping that I'll have the opportunity to visit plenty of places in the future. </p>
